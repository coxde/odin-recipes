          >Truly a one-pot wonder, this dish is homey, comforting, and
          weeknight-friendly (thanks to the minimal cleanup). Rinse your rice
          until the water runs clear before adding to keep the grains from going
          clumpy or gummy in the pot.</em

        <li>¼ tsp. crushed red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>1 (14-oz.) can whole peeled tomatoes</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Shrimp and assembly</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>1 lb. large shrimp, peeled, deveined</li>
        <li>Kosher salt, freshly ground pepper</li>
        <li>1 cup jasmine rice, rinsed until water runs clear</li>
        <li>1 tsp. ground cumin</li>

        <li>2¾ cups low-sodium vegetable broth or water</li>
        <li>Chopped parsley (for serving)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Steps</h3>
      <h4>Sauce</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Heat oil in a medium Dutch oven or other heavy pot over medium-high.
          Cook onion and garlic, stirring occasionally, until onion is slightly
          softened, about 4 minutes. Add roasted red peppers and salt; season
          with black pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until mixture is
          jammy, 8–10 minutes. Add olives, tomato paste, and red pepper flakes
          and cook, stirring often, until paste is slightly darkened in color,
          about 3 minutes. Add tomatoes, crushing with your hands as you go, and
          their liquid and cook, stirring often, until slightly thickened, about
          4 minutes.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h4>Shrimp and assembly</h4>
      <ol start="2">
        <li>
          While the sauce is cooking, pat shrimp dry with paper towels. Season
          with salt and pepper; set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
          Stir rice, cumin, and turmeric into sauce, then pour in broth.
          Increase heat to high and bring to a boil. Cover pot, reduce heat to
          medium-low, and simmer, adjusting heat to low to maintain a simmer if
          needed, until rice is tender and liquid is mostly absorbed, about 15
          minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Uncover pot and stir in reserved shrimp. Re-cover pot and cook until
          shrimp are opaque throughout, about 3 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Divide shrimp and rice among bowls and top with parsley.</li>
      </ol>
