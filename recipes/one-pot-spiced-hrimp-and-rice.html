      <h3>Ingredients (4 servings)</h3>
      <h4>Sauce</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>2 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>4 garlic cloves, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>
          1 (16-oz.) jar roasted red peppers, drained, finely chopped (about 1¾
          cups)
        </li>
        <li>1 tsp. Diamond Crystal or ½ tsp. Morton kosher salt</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 cup green olives, smashed, pits removed</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp. double-concentrated tomato paste</li>
        <li>¼ tsp. crushed red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>1 (14-oz.) can whole peeled tomatoes</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Shrimp and assembly</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>1 lb. large shrimp, peeled, deveined</li>
        <li>Kosher salt, freshly ground pepper</li>
        <li>1 cup jasmine rice, rinsed until water runs clear</li>
        <li>1 tsp. ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 tsp. ground turmeric</li>
        <li>2¾ cups low-sodium vegetable broth or water</li>
        <li>Chopped parsley (for serving)</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Sauce</h4>
      <h5>Step 1</h5>
      <p>
        Heat oil in a medium Dutch oven or other heavy pot over medium-high.
        Cook onion and garlic, stirring occasionally, until onion is slightly
        softened, about 4 minutes. Add roasted red peppers and salt; season with
        black pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until mixture is jammy, 8–10
        minutes. Add olives, tomato paste, and red pepper flakes and cook,
        stirring often, until paste is slightly darkened in color, about 3
        minutes. Add tomatoes, crushing with your hands as you go, and their
        liquid and cook, stirring often, until slightly thickened, about 4
        minutes.
      </p>

      <h4>Shrimp and assembly</h4>
      <h5>Step 2</h5>
      <p>
        While the sauce is cooking, pat shrimp dry with paper towels. Season
        with salt and pepper; set aside.
      </p>

      <h5>Step 3</h5>
      <p>
        Stir rice, cumin, and turmeric into sauce, then pour in broth. Increase
        heat to high and bring to a boil. Cover pot, reduce heat to medium-low,
        and simmer, adjusting heat to low to maintain a simmer if needed, until
        rice is tender and liquid is mostly absorbed, about 15 minutes.
      </p>

      <h5>Step 4</h5>
      <p>
        Uncover pot and stir in reserved shrimp. Re-cover pot and cook until
        shrimp are opaque throughout, about 3 minutes.
      </p>

      <h5>Step 5</h5>
      <p>Divide shrimp and rice among bowls and top with parsley.</p>
