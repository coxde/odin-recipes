          >I have always thought that aguas frescas were born out of
          resourcefulness. If you only have one melon to juice but there are ten
          people coming over for lunch, how do you make it yield more? By
          turning it into an agua fresca. It is a wonderful fresh tradition
          shared by the entire country. It is the perfect drink to have when a
          fruit juice would be too much and plain water too boring. It has three
          basic ingredients: water, fruit, and sugar. The method is basically
          the same for all aguas. You can play with different fruit, herb, and
          spice combinations and by adjusting the sweetness levels to your taste
          and the ratio of water to fruit. For example, we like ours a bit more
          watery and I barely add any sugar.</em

      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>3 cups (710 ml/24 fl oz) water</li>
        <li>Juice of 3 grapefruits</li>
        <li>2 cups (430 g) guava puree (preferably from fresh guavas)</li>
        <li>Leaves from 1 sprig fresh rosemary</li>
        <li>½ cup (100 g) sugar, or to taste</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Step(s)</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          In a blender, combine all the ingredients, except the sugar, and blend
          well. Standard blender jars probably won’t fit all the ingredients so
          blend in batches. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a pitcher. Add
          sugar (or your preferred sweetener) to taste, adjusting for your own
          preference and based on how sweet the fruit is to begin with. Add
          enough ice to your liking. As an option, you can garnish with a piece
          of an ingredient in the agua. For example, a sprig of rosemary, a
          stick of cinnamon, or slices of lemon. Pour into ice-filled glasses.
